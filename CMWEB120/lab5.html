        <header>History
        
            <p>"A List Apart” began in 1997 as a mailing list for web designers published and curated by Jeffrey Zeldman and Brian Platz.

            <p>The web site has had three major visual designs. The original, designed by Jeffrey Zeldman, featured custom club-flyer style graphics that accompanied each article -- an unusual feature in the early days of the web. The first major redesign, by Jason Santa Maria in 2005, featured a softer color palate, and featured CSS-based templates by Eric Meyer and introduced the inclusion of custom illustrations by Kevin Cornell. The most recent update to the site, launched in January 2013, features a black-and-white design scheme by Mike PIck. It continues to prominently feature Kevin Cornell's illustrations, but takes a "content first" approach to design by reducing the presence of almost all brand and design elements in favor of article content.

            <header>A List Apart: The Web Design Survey</header>
            <p>Every year since 2007, A List Apart has surveyed the web design and development community and presented its findings in a series of reports. These reports claim to be the "first true picture” of the profession of web design as it is practiced worldwide. Topics covered include salary; title; educational background and its effect on salary, job satisfaction, and title; workplace discrimination by gender, age, and ethnicity; and more. Tens of thousands of respondents around the globe participate each year. The magazine provides anonymized raw data with each findings report so that readers may crunch their own numbers, verify A List Apart's findings, or conduct their own investigations.
