* insert the link to your js here
* remove the link below to the html5shiv
* add the "no-js" class to the html tags at the top
* you can also remove the link to respond.min.js if you included the MQ Polyfill in your modernizr build

<div id="FluidContent"><h2>Page Purpose</h2>
<p>I provide this initial page as a starting point for your portfolio of work for your CMWEB class. You are encouraged to either change the entire page or change those parts you believe would benefit from a change. I have created an overall structure for your initial work (improve upon this as needed). Note: if you make changes to this page, do not change the page name from index.html (this is the default page for your folder). That being said, you are free to change the contents to anything you desire (and you can change the look of this page and related pages). I simply provide this as a starting point. Note that the links on the right will not work (this is a web page class after all and you should be able to change these as needed). Also, I do not provide a default set of links at the bottom (although your pages should have them, you would need to create them on your own).</p>
<p>Note that this page uses <strong>responsive design concepts</strong>. View it in a smartphone, tablet, and desktop/ laptop and you will see differences. You might want to save this page or modify it as a starting point for your classes.</p></div>
